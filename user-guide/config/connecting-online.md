Connecting to OutFox Online is a simple process, but requires a few steps to go through beforehand.

Before starting this guide, **make sure you make an [OutFox Online account](https://outfox.online/register)** so you get access to your own dashboard for the following steps.

# Step 1: Connecting the client

In order to access OutFox Online, you need to make your OutFox client connect to the server. You can do this by going to Options -> Network Options, and you'll see an `OutFox Online` option on the list.

Just press enter, and you'll see its text update to `Connecting...` as it performs the handshake.

Once the connection has been established, or failed, you'll see a status on the bottom of your screen via the online overlay. If it's successful, then congrats, the client is now connected to the online component!

# Step 2: Linking a profile

Now that the client is connected, it's time to link a local profile that you have to your account. You can have many profiles assigned to your profile, which you use to categorize your plays.

Maybe you want a profile that is for pure keyboard play, or one for playing on a real cabinet? You can just make a profile for it!

- Head to the `Profiles` section on the Options Menu to enter the profile selector.
- Choose the profile you want to link to your account.
- Select "Link Online Account".
> If the profile is already linked, it will say "Relink Online Account" instead.

This will ask for a Link Code, which you can find on your online dashboard. So head to https://outfox.online/dashboard to generate one. 

Click on the "Link Additional" button on the dashboard, and a new section will appear with instructions on what to do next with this code.

Once you provide the link code, you'll see a confirmation message saying that the account is linked!

# Step 3: Using the profile

At this point, you can just play like normal. There's no more steps to do as the game will automatically login with your profile when you start playing. You'll see this as the login screen automatically shows up.

# Step 4: Playing outside of your computer

If you're not on the computer you made the profile in, there's nothing to worry about. **You can still use the same profile on other machines/cabinets that use Project OutFox!**

All you'll need to do is generate a Login Pin for your specific profile. This will be used on the guest login prompt.
