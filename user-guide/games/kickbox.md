## About

## History:

This mode was added in StepMania 5. It was designed to be a fitness based punch and kick mode commissioned by a member of the community.

It has always been considered obscure, but it does have a functioning autogen system, and is functional again from _Project OutFox_ 4.10.0. 

You need to ensure you click the 'use SM5 noteskins' on the windows installer to allow yourself access to this mode if you are using _Project OutFox_.
