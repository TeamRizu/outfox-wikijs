The editor brings editor specific changes that allow you to tweak certain aspects for editing your content.

## Preferences introduced on 5.0.0-editor-preview-r0 to 5.0.0-editor-preview-r27
| Preference Name | Action |
| -- | -- |
| Show Both Players | Toggles the display of both players during playback.<br>**Note:** Both players are generated anyway during charts that allow for more than one player (like Single, or Versus). Other chart types won't be affected by this setting. |
| Show Measure Lines on Playback | Toggles the measure lines during playback. These are the horizontal lines shown during editing, which you may want to disable when previewing sections of a file that you may need full clarity. |
| Show Modifiers List | Shows a list of modifiers currently active on the player on their respective side that updates in real time. |
| Auto Advance Upon Note Placement | Auto advances the cursor to the next quantized beat from the currently selected snap after placing a note. ***(Experimental)*** |
| Show Backgrounds | Choose whenever to display song backgrounds while playing. This also affects the display of the backgrounds on the Foreground layer, which are used for chart modding. |
| Allow Notefield Changes on Preview | Enables the preview notefield (Which is enabled by pressing Space) to display chart-related changes like Scroll Speed changes, that change the spacing of the notes.
