When applying text on a [BitmapText](/en/dev/actors/actortypes/bitmaptext/_index) actor, depending on the font, some glyphs might not present themselves properly. Let's take the following example, which attempts to load a text with the value `H̶e̵a̶d̸g̷r̴i̸n̶d̴e̴r̶`, which is `Headgrinder` with some special unicode to add non-spacing strikes in the text.

![textbrokenglyph.png](/resources/actors/bitmaptext/textbrokenglyph.png){.align-center}

In this example, the glyphs representing the special unicode symbols are not found in this custom font, so they show `?` symbols instead (from the `Common default` glyph image list), to indicate the missing element.

![textproperglyph.png](/resources/actors/bitmaptext/textproperglyph.png){.align-center}

All glyphs are available on this font, so the text is properly shown.

If the need comes to use a font but glyphs are not possible to be retrieved, then you can use the AltText variable from within `settext`, which can be used as a failsafe if the current string includes an unavailable glyph.

```lua
-- First argument is the original text, while the second is the alternative variant for compatibility.
self:settext( "H̶e̵a̶d̸g̷r̴i̸n̶d̴e̴r̶", "Headgrinder" )
```

With the code above, the case will be that the first image on the left will default to the second variable, given the missing glyphs from its sheet.
