# ScreenOutfoxOnlineLogin
This screen takes care of loading online profiles, processing link token requests, invalid tokens, duplicates, and many other elements.

## Workflow

If no profiles are loaded at all, if the machine has the `AllowGuestProfiles` option enabled from [ScreenOptionsNetwork](/dev/screens/ScreenOptionsNetwork), each user will be prompted for a 4-digit Link code, which they can access from their Outfox Online dashboard. They can also use an NFC card that contains the token code for their profile to sign in as well.

If a user has a profile that is locally stored on the machine, the game will automatically attempt to login with their provided token. If this process fails, they'll be prompted with the same 4-digit screen as if there was no profile, where the difference is that upon successful sync, it updates the profile's token with the correct one for future logins.
