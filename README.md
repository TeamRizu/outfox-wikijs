Welcome to the documentation wiki for Project OutFox! 

Project OutFox is a multi mode mix of rhythm, simulation and parser compatibility to create a unique sandbox experience for players.

It allows for complete customisation in its 19 simulation modes, allowing for many thousands of choices in how one can play. It was born from a project based on StepMania's 5.1-b2 branch that has massively grown in scope.

This wiki is still a work in progress, so keep checking back for updates on new content. Commit access is limited to the development team, but you can always perform pull requests too!
